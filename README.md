# Basic Graph Library
Initally a personal project that was meant to be a way for me to learn about graph algorithms, later turned into a school project, this is a library with classes for Graphs, DiGraphs and Grids and search algorithm such as BFS, DFS and checking if the graph is Bipartite.
After setting the nodes(vertices) and edges, you can call any of the search algorithm and then print the search path.
Each individual node can be named(except in grids) and blocked/unblocked.

Also, due to being requred from me as a school project, it also features an interactive mode, called with `interactive_mode()`, where one can with simple commands create graphs and digraphs. Currently, unless in the unlikely event that someone actually wanted it, i dont have any plans to expand the interactive mode.

### Future improvements:
* Add more search algorithms
